2. `02-intermediate-*.md`: Workflows, caching, data passing.
3. `03-advanced-*.md`: Extensibility, matrix builds, complex pipelines.
4. `04-staff-*.md`: Enterprise scaling, highly available infrastructure, rigorous security.
5. `05-top-100-*-questions.md`: A rapid-fire cheat sheet for interview prep.
